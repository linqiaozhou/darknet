1: change the NMS such as replace the default NMS as soft NMS, I have did the experiment which result shows that the soft NMS
   is useful when the scence is crowded.
2: the data process can be optimazed since the clip will bring some problem 
3: focal loss need to be try 
4: there are three output layers, while the three layers do not have the same negtive sample when they have same positive sample
   (the code in yolo_layer.c shows that),I think this is one of the reasons that yolov3 do not have a good performance in big object
5:以 YOLOv3 为例，默认对于 regression 损失都会上一个 (2-w*h) 的损失，w 和 h 分别是ground truth 的宽和高。如果不减去 w*h，AP 会有一个明显下降。如果继续往上加，如  (2-w*h)*1.5，总体的 AP 还会涨一个点左右（包括验证集和测试集）。当然这大概也有 COCO 中小物体实在太多的原因。
